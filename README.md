# Skylax

Created at the NASA Space Apps 2016 hackathon in Kitchener-Waterloo tackling the 'Geotagging Space and Aviation' challenge. 

Skylax is an educational tool for K-12 students to develop a better understanding of the solar system by visually presenting humanityâ€™s scientific discoveries relative to specific moments in time.
